# Contributing to win32

### TODO(halildurmus): Update the following content to reflect the current state of the project.

Contributions are very much appreciated. With thousands of Win32 APIs, there's a
lot of ground to cover. Don't hesitate to ask questions.

Some tips:

## Classic Win32 APIs

- When wrapping a Win32 API, use the Unicode (`'W'`) wide variants of these
  APIs, rather than the ANSI (`'A'`) variants. For example:
  [CredWriteW][credwritew_link], rather than [CredWriteA][credwritea_link].

- To create a new API, *don't* edit the main library files themselves; these get
  overwritten. Instead, edit the
  [win32_functions.json][win32_functions_json_link] file and execute the
  `tool\generate.cmd` script to update the library files.

- Structs can be auto-generated by including them in the
  [win32_structs.json][win32_structs_json_link] file and executing the
  `tool\generate.cmd` script, which will generate the corresponding Dart files.

- Constants belong in the [constants.dart][constants_dart_link]; please add
  documentation. In rare cases (where the constant is truly self-documenting),
  you may add to the [constants_nodoc.dart][constants_nodoc_dart_link], although
  the goal is to gradually document more constants.

- There are plenty of good existing patterns to build off in these locations;
  try to mirror an existing function if you can for consistency!

- Ideally pull requests for new API submissions include a sample (`example\`
  directory) and some tests (`tests\` directory).

## COM APIs

Begin by editing the [com_types.json][com_types_json_link] file, specifying the
desired COM interface, and then execute the `tool\generate.cmd` script to
generate the relevant class in the `lib\src\com` directory.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help][about_pull_requests] for more information on using pull requests.

## Coding style

The Dart source code in this repo follows the
[Effective Dart: Style guidelines][effective_dart_style]

You should familiarize yourself with those guidelines.

## File headers

All files in the Dart project must start with the following header; if you add a
new file please also add this. The year should be a single number stating the
year the file was created (don't use a range like "2011-2012"). Additionally, if
you edit an existing file, you shouldn't update the year.
