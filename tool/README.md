This folder contains utilities to help with developing the win32 package.

# Code-generation tools

The Win32 and COM APIs available in this package are generated from metadata
supplied by Microsoft. The metadata is in the form of an ECMA-335 specification
file, generated from this repo: <https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata>

The metadata is extracted and parsed using the separate winmd package:
  <https://pub.dev/packages/winmd>

Not every API is projected.

- For Win32 APIs, the JSON files prefixed with `win32_` in the `generator\data`
  directory are used to determine which APIs to project.
- For COM APIs, the `com_types.json` file in the `generator\data` directory
  explicitly names the types that should be projected.

During the build process, you should call `generate.cmd` from the project root
to instantiate these types and generate the classes from them, for example:

```terminal
C:\src\win32> tool\generate.cmd
```

This tool will also test both the generation library and the generated output
with unit tests.

# Other utilities

This folder also includes a few other small utilities of limited usefulness.

- `build.cmd`. Generates EXE files for some of the Dart samples.
- `struct_sizes\struct_sizes.cpp`. Measures the size of structs in
  structs.g.dart on 64-bit architectures so the appropriate unit tests can be
  generated.
